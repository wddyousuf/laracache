# AutoCache

Automatic, self-invalidating query caching for Eloquent models.

Add one trait to a model and its read queries are cached transparently. Any
write — including bulk, raw, and event-suppressing "quiet" writes — flushes
that model's cache automatically, so you never serve stale data.

Invalidation uses **cache tags** when the store supports them (immediate,
targeted flushing) and falls back to a **per-model version counter** on every
other store (`file`, `database`, `array`, …). Either way, it just works.

## Requirements

- PHP 8.1+
- Laravel 10, 11, 12, or 13

On Laravel 13, `config/cache.php` ships `'serializable_classes' => false`, which
forbids unserializing PHP objects out of a serializing cache store (file,
database, redis, memcached) to guard against gadget-chain attacks. AutoCache
works out of the box under this default — it caches only arrays and scalars, so
you do **not** need to add `stdClass` (or your models) to the allow-list.

## Installation

Install via Composer:

```bash
composer require wddyousuf/eloquent-autocache
```

The service provider and `AutoCache` facade are auto-discovered — no manual
registration needed.

Optionally publish the config file to `config/autocache.php`:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=autocache-config
```

That's the whole setup. Every store works out of the box; there's nothing to
migrate and no external service to run.

## Quick start

Add the `Cacheable` trait to any Eloquent model:

```php
use Wddyousuf\AutoCache\Traits\Cacheable;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Post extends Model
{
    use Cacheable;
}
```

Now reads are cached and writes flush automatically:

```php
Post::where('published', true)->get();   // hits the DB, caches the result
Post::where('published', true)->get();   // served from cache
Post::count();                           // cached
Post::find(1);                           // cached (per-row, see below)

Post::create(['title' => 'Hello']);      // flushes Post's cache

Post::where('published', true)->get();   // fresh from the DB again
```

## How it works

1. The `Cacheable` trait backs the model with a `CachedQueryBuilder`.
2. Every SELECT funnels through the builder's `runSelect()` (and `exists()`),
   so `get`, `first`, `find`, `pluck`, `value`, `count`, `sum`, `exists`, and
   even the pagination count query are all cached from one place.
3. Every write funnels through the builder's write methods, which flush the
   model's cache — catching bulk updates, raw inserts, `increment`, `truncate`,
   and quiet writes that bypass model events.
4. Flushing either clears the model's cache tags or bumps a per-model version
   counter, depending on whether the store supports tags.
5. Only plain data is ever written to the cache — query rows are stored as
   arrays and `find()` stores a row's raw attributes, never a serialized
   `stdClass` or Eloquent model. This keeps AutoCache compatible with Laravel
   13's secure-by-default `cache.serializable_classes` allow-list (see
   [Requirements](#requirements)).

## What triggers a flush

- `create` / `save` / `update` / `delete` / `restore` / `forceDelete`
- Bulk `Post::where(...)->update()` / `->delete()` (including joined updates)
- Raw `insert` / `upsert` / `insertOrIgnore` / `insertUsing` / `insertOrIgnoreUsing`
- `updateFrom`
- `increment` / `decrement`
- `truncate`
- The `*Quietly()` variants (`saveQuietly`, `updateQuietly`, …)

## Per-query controls

```php
Post::withoutCache()->get();              // skip the cache for this query
Post::cacheFor(60)->get();                // custom TTL (seconds; null = forever) for this query
Post::cache()->where('active', 1)->get(); // explicitly opt in (opt-in mode)
Post::query()->cacheKey('homepage')->get(); // use a fixed cache key
```

Each also works from an existing builder chain, e.g.
`Post::where(...)->withoutCache()->get()`.

## Caching modes (auto vs opt-in)

By default (`mode => 'auto'`) every read is cached. Set the mode to `opt-in`
to cache **only** queries you explicitly mark:

```php
// config/autocache.php
'mode' => 'opt-in',
```

```php
Post::all();                 // NOT cached
Post::cache()->get();        // cached
Post::cacheFor(120)->get();  // cached (cacheFor implies opt-in)
```

The mode can also be set per model, overriding the global setting:

```php
class AuditLog extends Model
{
    use Cacheable;

    protected $cacheMode = 'opt-in'; // or 'auto'
}
```

Writes always flush, regardless of mode.

## Row-level caching

Canonical `find($id)` lookups are cached under a stable per-row key, so a
single row's cache **survives writes to other rows**:

```php
Post::find(1);   // cached
Post::find(2);   // cached

Post::find(2)->update(['title' => 'Changed']); // only row 2's cache is dropped

Post::find(1);   // still served from cache
Post::find(2);   // refetched (fresh)
```

Bulk updates, `truncate`, and `upsert` clear all row caches (they may touch
unknown rows). Missing rows are never cached, so a later insert is picked up
immediately. Non-canonical finds (extra constraints, custom columns, removed
scopes, eager loads) fall back to normal query caching.

Disable it with `'row_cache' => false` (or per model, see below). Row-level
survival applies to version-counter stores; tag stores flush per-model.

## Relationship-aware invalidation

Flush a parent (or any related model) whenever this model changes:

```php
class Comment extends Model
{
    use Cacheable;

    protected $flushRelated = ['post']; // relation name or model class

    public function post()
    {
        return $this->belongsTo(Post::class);
    }
}
```

Creating or updating a `Comment` now also flushes the cached `Post` queries.

### Many-to-many (pivot) writes

`$flushRelated` covers `belongsTo` / `hasMany`, but a **many-to-many** write —
`$post->tags()->sync()`, `->attach()`, `->detach()` — is a bare pivot statement
that never touches a cacheable model's builder, so a cached relation read
(`$post->tags`, or any query that joins the pivot) keeps serving stale rows until
its TTL expires. When the pivot gates authorization, that is unsafe.

Map each pivot table to the cacheable models whose reads it can change:

```php
// config/autocache.php
'pivot_invalidation' => [
    'map' => [
        'post_tag'  => [App\Models\Post::class, App\Models\Tag::class],
        'role_user' => [App\Models\Role::class, App\Models\User::class],
    ],
],
```

AutoCache then watches the query stream and flushes those models on any write to
a listed pivot — wherever it originates (Eloquent, a Filament relation manager,
or raw SQL). List both sides that are cacheable; a non-cacheable class in the map
is skipped. The listener is only registered when the map is non-empty, so there
is no query-stream overhead if you don't use the feature.

## Stale-while-revalidate

On Laravel 11+, serve an expired value instantly while it recomputes in the
background (via `Cache::flexible()`):

```php
// config/autocache.php
'ttl' => 60,   // fresh for 60s
'swr' => 30,   // then served stale for up to 30s more while refreshing
```

SWR needs a finite TTL, and it is skipped for models with a `max_rows` cap
(the background refresh cannot apply the size guard).

## Facade & Artisan commands

```php
use Wddyousuf\AutoCache\Facades\AutoCache;

AutoCache::flush(Post::class);   // flush one model
AutoCache::clear();              // flush all registered models
AutoCache::warm(Post::class);    // pre-populate a model's cache
AutoCache::warmAll();            // warm every registered model
AutoCache::stats();              // ['hits' => ..., 'misses' => ...]
AutoCache::resetStats();         // zero the counters (optionally per model)
```

```bash
php artisan autocache:flush "App\Models\Post"
php artisan autocache:clear
php artisan autocache:warm "App\Models\Post"
php artisan autocache:warm --all
php artisan autocache:stats
php artisan autocache:stats --reset
```

Customize what warming runs by overriding `cacheWarmupQueries()` on the model:

```php
public function cacheWarmupQueries(): array
{
    return [
        static::query(),
        static::where('published', true),
    ];
}
```

`clear` and `warm` discover models registered at runtime; list any that must
be reachable before boot in `config('autocache.models')`.

## Events

Three events are dispatched so you can log or measure cache behavior:

- `Wddyousuf\AutoCache\Events\CacheHit`
- `Wddyousuf\AutoCache\Events\CacheMissed`
- `Wddyousuf\AutoCache\Events\CacheFlushed`

Each carries the `$model` (and, for hit/miss, the `$key`).

## Testing your application

Swap in a recording fake and assert on cache behavior — no counting SQL by
hand:

```php
use Wddyousuf\AutoCache\Facades\AutoCache;

public function test_publishing_flushes_the_cache(): void
{
    $fake = AutoCache::fake();

    Post::factory()->create();

    $fake->assertFlushed(Post::class);
}
```

Available assertions:

```php
$fake->assertFlushed(Post::class);
$fake->assertNotFlushed(Post::class);
$fake->assertNothingFlushed();
$fake->assertHit(Post::class);    // or assertHit() for "any"
$fake->assertMissed(Post::class); // or assertMissed() for "any"
```

## Configuration

`config/autocache.php` (every key is env-driven):

| Key                 | Default          | Description                                                        |
|---------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `enabled`           | `true`           | Master on/off switch.                                              |
| `store`             | `null`           | Cache store (`null` = app default).                               |
| `ttl`               | `3600`           | Seconds to cache; `null` = forever.                               |
| `ttl_jitter`        | `0.1`            | Randomly spread each TTL by ±this fraction (anti thundering-herd). |
| `prefix`            | `autocache`      | Key prefix.                                                        |
| `mode`              | `auto`           | `auto` caches everything; `opt-in` caches only `->cache()` queries. |
| `row_cache`         | `true`           | Per-row caching for canonical `find($id)`.                        |
| `swr`               | `0`              | Stale-while-revalidate grace seconds (Laravel 11+; 0 = off).      |
| `use_tags`          | `auto`           | `auto`/`true` = tags when supported; `false` = version counter.   |
| `lock_for`          | `10`             | Seconds to hold a stampede lock (needs a lock-capable store; 0 off). |
| `max_rows`          | `null`           | Skip caching result sets larger than this.                        |
| `volatile_patterns` | `now(), rand(, …`| Queries containing these substrings are never cached.             |
| `stats`             | `false`          | Collect hit/miss counters.                                        |
| `models`            | `[]`             | Models for `clear`/`warm` to discover before boot.                |

Env variables: `AUTOCACHE_ENABLED`, `AUTOCACHE_STORE`, `AUTOCACHE_TTL`,
`AUTOCACHE_TTL_JITTER`, `AUTOCACHE_PREFIX`, `AUTOCACHE_MODE`,
`AUTOCACHE_ROW_CACHE`, `AUTOCACHE_SWR`, `AUTOCACHE_USE_TAGS`,
`AUTOCACHE_LOCK_FOR`, `AUTOCACHE_MAX_ROWS`, `AUTOCACHE_STATS`.

## Per-model overrides

Declare any of these properties to override the global config for one model:

```php
class Post extends Model
{
    use Cacheable;

    protected $cacheStore   = 'redis';     // this model's store
    protected $cacheTtl     = 600;         // seconds; null = forever
    protected $cacheEnabled = true;        // disable caching for just this model
    protected $cacheMode    = 'opt-in';    // 'auto' or 'opt-in' for this model
    protected $cacheTags    = ['catalog']; // extra tags (tag mode)
    protected $cacheMaxRows = 5000;        // skip caching larger results
    protected $flushRelated = ['comments'];// relations/models to co-flush
}
```

## Laravel Octane

AutoCache is Octane-safe: it registers listeners on `RequestReceived`,
`TaskReceived`, and `TickReceived` to reset its process-static flush guard
between requests, so a long-lived worker never carries state across requests.
Nothing to configure.

## Limitations & notes

- **Eager-loaded relations** are cached as part of the related model's own
  queries (which must also use `Cacheable`). A change to a related model does
  not flush a parent's *root* query unless you wire it up with `$flushRelated`.
- **`cursor()`** streams and is intentionally never cached.
- **Tag mode flushes the whole model on every write.** With a taggable store
  (redis, memcached), any write clears the model's entire tag; the surgical
  single-row flush only applies to the version-counter path (`row_cache`, on
  non-taggable stores). Prefer caching read-heavy / write-light models in tag
  mode — a model written on nearly every request gains little.
- **Direct `DB::table()` writes** bypass Eloquent entirely; call
  `AutoCache::flush(Model::class)` afterward if you use them.
- The **version counter** on non-atomic stores (`file`) can, under heavy
  concurrent writes, briefly miss an increment. Use an atomic store (redis,
  memcached) or a taggable store for high-write workloads.
- **Row caching stores raw attributes, not the model.** Every `find($id)`
  reconstructs a fresh model instance from the cached attributes, so unsaved
  changes to a returned model are never leaked to later calls — this holds on
  the `array` store too, and keeps the cache safe to unserialize under Laravel
  13's `serializable_classes` allow-list.

## Comparison with other packages

Several excellent packages cache Eloquent queries. AutoCache's focus is
**complete write-path coverage on any cache store** — no Redis requirement,
and no write that can slip past invalidation.

¹ Requires Redis, Memcached, APC, or DynamoDB; `file`, `database`, and `array`
  stores are unsupported.
² Per-query caching works anywhere, but *automatic* invalidation requires a
  taggable store.
³ Caches only queries marked `cacheFor()` (or a model-wide `$cacheFor`
  property).
⁴ Invalidation hooks Eloquent model events, so writes that bypass events
  (bulk builder writes, raw inserts, quiet saves) leave stale cache entries.
  AutoCache and lada-cache hook the query-builder layer instead.

[rememberable](https://github.com/dwightwatson/rememberable) is also worth a
mention: a minimal manual `remember($seconds)` per query, with no automatic
invalidation. And
[mostafaznv/laracache](https://github.com/mostafaznv/laracache) is a
different approach entirely — you predefine named `CacheEntity` queries on the
model rather than caching reads transparently.
